 This a repository for the Springer monograph entitled: 'Radar Remote Sensing for Crop Biophysical Parameter Estimation', D. Mandal, A. Bhattacharya, Y. S. Rao.
 https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-4424-5

 This book presents a timely investigation of radar remote sensing observations for agricultural crop monitoring and advancements of research techniques and their applicability for crop biophysical parameter estimation. It introduces theoretical background of radar scattering from vegetation volume and semi-empirical modelling approaches that are the foundation for biophysical parameter inversion. The contents will help readers explore the state-of-the-art crop monitoring and biophysical parameter estimation using approaches radar remote sensing. It will assist as a reference book for academicians, researchers and physical scientists working in radar remote sensing for agricultural crop mapping and monitoring and translating research into operation.
 
 Some key features:
 <ul>
 <li> Details the development of physical models and highlights the evolution of semi-empirical models</li>
 <li> Focuses on state-of-the-art methods for radar vegetation indices and methods for inversion</li>
 <li> Includes the program codes of theoretical and semi-empirical models, calibration and inversion approaches</li>
 </ul>
 
In the spirit of open science development, in book include program codes shared in Github repository.
